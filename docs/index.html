        <p>
          Currently, I'm working on gqlpen, another GraphQL client IDE
          (experimental) that's minimalistic. Think of it like codepen, it's
          minimal and has just enough features. It's still a work in progress so
          hopefully, I can finish it soon, and share it with the world! You can
          find it
          <a href="https://github.com/azmy60/gqlpen">here</a>, I'll appreciate
          any contributions! :D
